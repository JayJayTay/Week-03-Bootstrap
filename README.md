Week 03 Bootstrap Art Website.


02.24.2025: linked google fonts, polished up my table, added forms and realigned photos. 
changed pencils photo (looks better). Still need to brushh up on navigational decoration and color.
Google fonts looks artsy.
I want to figure out how to change the background to a splashy paint picture, MORE RESEARCH.


As of 02.25.25 I have finally worked out my more irritating kinks that of:
    fixing the nav link colors
    aligning the nav to be centered
    ensuring all nav bars match
    getting all photos on the home page to be reactive to viewport width depending on size
    making sure that all fonts are uniformed
    changing image of pencils page
